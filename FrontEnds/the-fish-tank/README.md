# The Fish Tank

An interactive web experience at [the-fish-tank.com](https://the-fish-tank.com) featuring a live weather dashboard and three simulations: a swimming fish aquarium, autonomous tank combat, and aerial dogfighting.

## Tech Stack

Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no build tools. Entities (fish, tanks, planes) are rendered with SVG elements; effects (bubbles, smoke, debris) use CSS keyframe animations.

## Architecture

Single-page app with five views managed by a view controller in `index.html`. Each module is an IIFE that exposes `start()` and `stop()` lifecycle methods. The controller switches views, swaps CSS themes, and manages module lifecycle.

### Views

- **Home** — Landing page with navigation
- **Potter Weather Predictions** — Live weather readings and ML-powered hourly forecasts from a Netatmo weather station
- **Fish Tank** — Click-to-spawn swimming fish with physics and wobble animation
- **Tank Battle** — Autonomous combat vehicles with turret AI, health bars, and explosions
- **Fighter Fish** — Aerial dogfight with flight physics, missiles, and crash sequences

### Theme System

Three CSS themes applied via body class, switching automatically with the active view:

- `theme-ocean` — Blue aquatic (Home, Weather, Fish Tank)
- `theme-battle` — Green/brown earthy (Tank Battle)
- `theme-sky` — Blue sky (Fighter Fish)

### Weather Dashboard

Displays current indoor/outdoor temperature readings from a Netatmo weather station and a next-hour ML forecast with model version. Below the cards, a prediction history table shows past forecasts alongside actual readings with color-coded accuracy deltas (green < 1°, yellow 1-2°, pink > 2°).

User preferences persisted in localStorage:
- Temperature unit toggle (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
- Time format toggle (12h / 24h)

Data is loaded from `data/weather.json`, fetched from GitHub raw CDN with a local fallback. The file is generated by a backend pipeline that runs hourly via GitHub Actions.

## Development

No build step. Open `index.html` in a browser to run locally.

## Deployment

GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions ([`pages.yml`](../../.github/workflows/pages.yml)). Deploys automatically on push to `main` when files in `FrontEnds/the-fish-tank/` change. Custom domain configured via `CNAME`.
